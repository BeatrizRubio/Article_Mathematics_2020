# Neural-Network-Based Curve Fitting Using Totally Positive Rational Bases

In this repository, the code for the experimentation is provided. Different curves were approximated using a one-hidden-layer neural network that uses rational basis as activation functions. Different rational basis were used.

1. In [Experiments_table](https://github.com/BeatrizRubio/Article_Mathematics_2020/tree/main/Experiments_table) the code for Table 1 is provided.
2. The architecture and training implementation is described in the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/BeatrizRubio/Article_Mathematics_2020/tree/main/Neural%20network%20implementation). (Can be seen in markdown version [here](https://github.com/BeatrizRubio/Article_Mathematics_2020/blob/main/Neural%20network%20implementation/Neural%20network%20implementation.md)).

The implementation uses Tensorflow 2.0.
